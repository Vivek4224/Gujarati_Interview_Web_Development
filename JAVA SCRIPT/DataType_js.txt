Here are 10 questions and answers related to **data types in JavaScript**:

### 1. **What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: The primitive data types in JavaScript are:
   - **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
   - **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   - **BigInt**: Represents large integers (beyond the limit of the Number type).
   - **Boolean**: Represents `true` or `false`.
   - **undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - **Symbol**: A unique and immutable value often used as object property keys.
   - **null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

### 2. **What is a `null` value in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: `null` is a primitive data type that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate "no value" or "empty value."

### 3. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: 
   - `undefined` is a default value assigned to a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - `null` is an intentional assignment that represents the absence of any value or object.

### 4. **What is the `typeof` operator in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: The `typeof` operator is used to check the type of a variable or expression. It returns a string indicating the data type of the operand. Example:
   ```javascript
   typeof "hello"; // "string"
   typeof 42;      // "number"
   typeof true;    // "boolean"
   typeof {};      // "object"
   ```

### 5. **What is the difference between `Object` and `Primitive` data types?**
   **Answer**: 
   - **Primitive types** (string, number, boolean, etc.) are immutable and hold simple values.
   - **Object types** (objects, arrays, functions) can store collections of data and are mutable.

### 6. **What is the `typeof` result for an array in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: The `typeof` operator returns `"object"` for arrays, as arrays are a special type of object in JavaScript. Example:
   ```javascript
   typeof [1, 2, 3]; // "object"
   ```

### 7. **What is a `BigInt` in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: `BigInt` is a special data type that allows for representation of integers larger than the maximum value that a regular `Number` type can store. Example:
   ```javascript
   const bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
   ```

### 8. **What are `symbol` data types used for in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: `Symbol` is a primitive data type used to create unique identifiers for object properties. They are often used to avoid name clashes in object properties, especially in libraries or frameworks.

### 9. **What is type coercion in JavaScript?**
   **Answer**: Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another in JavaScript. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number is coerced into a string:
   ```javascript
   5 + "5"; // "55"
   ```

### 10. **Can JavaScript have mixed data types in an array?**
   **Answer**: Yes, JavaScript arrays can contain elements of different data types. An array can store strings, numbers, objects, booleans, etc., all in a single array.
   ```javascript
   let arr = [1, "hello", true, {name: "John"}];
   ```

These questions focus on the different data types in JavaScript and their behavior, helping to build a solid understanding of how JavaScript handles different kinds of data.
