Here are the **top 10 questions and answers** related to **`useReducer`** in React, which will help a **fresher** prepare for a React interview:

---

### **1. What is `useReducer` in React?**

**Answer**:  
`useReducer` is a hook in React that is used to manage more complex state logic in a functional component. It is similar to `useState`, but instead of just updating state, it uses a reducer function to handle state transitions. `useReducer` is typically used when the state logic is more complicated or involves multiple sub-values or actions.

Example:

```jsx
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **2. How does `useReducer` differ from `useState`?**

**Answer**:  
- **`useState`** is used for simple state management, typically when state values are primitive types or just a single value.
- **`useReducer`** is used for managing complex state, especially when the next state depends on the previous state or involves multiple sub-values. It also allows handling actions in a more structured way, similar to Redux.

In `useReducer`, a reducer function defines how the state should change based on different actions.

---

### **3. When should you use `useReducer` over `useState`?**

**Answer**:  
You should use `useReducer` when:
- The state logic is complex and involves multiple sub-values.
- State changes depend on the previous state.
- You need to handle more complex actions (e.g., in response to user events, API responses).
- You want to manage state in a more structured way (similar to Redux).

For simple state updates, `useState` is often preferred as it's more concise.

---

### **4. What are the parameters of the `useReducer` hook?**

**Answer**:  
`useReducer` takes two parameters:
1. **A reducer function**: A function that specifies how the state changes in response to actions.
2. **An initial state**: The initial state value before any action is dispatched.

The reducer function receives the current state and an action and returns the new state.

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

---

### **5. What is the reducer function?**

**Answer**:  
The reducer function is a function that defines how the state should be updated in response to specific actions. It takes two arguments:
1. **`state`**: The current state.
2. **`action`**: An object that describes the action to perform.

It returns the new state.

Example of a reducer function:

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

### **6. How do you dispatch an action with `useReducer`?**

**Answer**:  
You dispatch an action by calling the `dispatch` function returned by `useReducer`. The action is typically an object that contains a `type` and possibly additional data to help update the state.

Example:

```jsx
dispatch({ type: 'increment' });  // Action with a type of 'increment'
```

---

### **7. Can you pass additional data in the action when dispatching?**

**Answer**:  
Yes, you can pass additional data in the action object. This is often useful when you need to update the state with dynamic values.

Example:

```jsx
dispatch({ type: 'setCount', payload: 5 });  // Action with a 'payload' for dynamic data
```

In the reducer, you can handle this data:

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'setCount':
      return { count: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

### **8. Can `useReducer` be used with asynchronous actions?**

**Answer**:  
`useReducer` itself does not directly handle asynchronous actions. However, you can dispatch actions asynchronously by using side-effects, such as within `useEffect` or with `async` functions.

Example with `useEffect` and `async`:

```jsx
function fetchData(dispatch) {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      dispatch({ type: 'setData', payload: data });
    });
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData(dispatch);
  }, []);

  return <div>{state.data}</div>;
}
```

---

### **9. How do you use multiple `useReducer` hooks in a single component?**

**Answer**:  
You can use multiple `useReducer` hooks in a single component to manage different pieces of state independently. Each `useReducer` will manage its own part of the state and its own dispatch function.

Example:

```jsx
const [countState, dispatchCount] = useReducer(countReducer, { count: 0 });
const [textState, dispatchText] = useReducer(textReducer, { text: '' });

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{countState.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatchCount({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>

      <p>{textState.text}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatchText({ type: 'updateText', payload: 'Hello' })}>
        Update Text
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **10. What are the advantages of using `useReducer` over `useState`?**

**Answer**:  
- **Better management of complex state**: `useReducer` is better suited for managing complex state that involves multiple sub-values or more complicated state transitions.
- **More predictable state updates**: It centralizes the state update logic in a single reducer function, making it easier to understand how the state changes.
- **Decouples state logic from UI**: `useReducer` separates state changes from the UI components, making it easier to maintain and test.

`useReducer` is especially useful when the component has multiple state variables that change based on different actions.
