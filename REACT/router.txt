Here are some **questions and answers** related to **React Router** for a fresher's interview:

---

### **1. What is React Router?**
React Router is a library for handling routing in a React application. It allows you to navigate between different views (components) and manage the URL in the browser, providing a dynamic way to render components based on the current URL.

---

### **2. How do you install React Router?**
You can install React Router using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
# or
yarn add react-router-dom
```

---

### **3. What are the main components of React Router?**
- **`BrowserRouter`**: A high-level component that uses HTML5 history API to manage navigation.
- **`Route`**: Defines a mapping between a URL and a component.
- **`Link`**: Allows navigation between different routes without reloading the page.
- **`Switch`**: Renders only the first `Route` that matches the current location.
- **`Redirect`**: Redirects the user to a different route.

---

### **4. How do you set up routing in a React app?**
You wrap your app in `BrowserRouter`, then use `Route` to map URLs to components.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

---

### **5. What is the difference between `Route` and `Link` in React Router?**
- **`Route`**: Used to define which component should be rendered based on the URL.
- **`Link`**: Used to navigate to different routes without reloading the page.

```javascript
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

---

### **6. What is `exact` in `Route`?**
The `exact` keyword ensures that the route is only matched if the URL is exactly the same as the route path. Without it, the route can partially match and render the component.

```javascript
<Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
```

Without `exact`, `/about` would also match `/`, rendering the `Home` component.

---

### **7. How can you pass parameters to a route in React Router?**
You can pass parameters using the URL and access them via `props.match.params`.

```javascript
<Route path="/user/:id" component={UserDetail} />

// Accessing the parameter inside the component
function UserDetail({ match }) {
  return <h1>User ID: {match.params.id}</h1>;
}
```

---

### **8. How do you navigate programmatically in React Router?**
You can use the `useHistory` hook (in React Router v5) or `useNavigate` (in React Router v6) to navigate programmatically.

**React Router v5:**
```javascript
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

function MyComponent() {
  const history = useHistory();
  const handleClick = () => {
    history.push("/about");
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About</button>;
}
```

**React Router v6:**
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate("/about");
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About</button>;
}
```

---

### **9. What is the purpose of `Switch` in React Router?**
`Switch` ensures that only the first `Route` or `Redirect` that matches the current URL will be rendered. Without it, React Router will render all matching routes.

```javascript
<Switch>
  <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
  <Route path="/about" component={About} />
</Switch>
```

---

### **10. How do you handle 404 pages (unknown routes) in React Router?**
You can use a `Route` without a `path` to render a fallback component, such as a "Not Found" page, when no routes match.

```javascript
<Switch>
  <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
  <Route path="/about" component={About} />
  <Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
```

---

### **11. What is `Redirect` in React Router?**
`Redirect` is used to programmatically redirect users to another route. It is typically used for handling redirects after a form submission or if the user is not authorized.

```javascript
import { Redirect } from "react-router-dom";

function ProtectedRoute() {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <Redirect to="/login" />;
  }
  return <div>Protected Content</div>;
}
```

---

### **12. How do you handle nested routes in React Router?**
You can nest `Route` components inside other components to create nested routes.

```javascript
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <Route path="/dashboard/overview" component={Overview} />
      <Route path="/dashboard/settings" component={Settings} />
    </div>
  );
}

<Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
```

---

### **13. What is `useParams()` in React Router?**
The `useParams` hook allows you to access the parameters from the current routeâ€™s URL. This is useful when you have dynamic routes that require parameters.

```javascript
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function User() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return <h1>User ID: {id}</h1>;
}
```

---

### **14. What is `useRouteMatch()` in React Router?**
The `useRouteMatch()` hook provides information about the current route, such as the URL, the `params` object, and the matched `Route`.

```javascript
import { useRouteMatch } from "react-router-dom";

function Dashboard() {
  let match = useRouteMatch();
  return <h2>Current Route: {match.path}</h2>;
}
```

---

### **15. What is `BrowserRouter` vs `HashRouter`?**
- **`BrowserRouter`**: Uses the HTML5 history API for navigation and works well with modern web browsers that support it.
- **`HashRouter`**: Uses the hash portion of the URL (e.g., `example.com/#/home`), which is useful for older browsers or in static file environments.

These questions and answers cover the core concepts of **React Router** and how to use it for navigation, route handling, and URL management in React applications. They are useful for preparing for interviews where React Router knowledge is required.
