Hereâ€™s a list of **questions and answers** related to **events in React**:

---

### **1. How do you handle events in React?**
React events are handled using camelCase syntax. Event handlers are written as functions and automatically pass an event object.

### **2. How do you pass arguments to event handlers in React?**
You can pass arguments using an arrow function or by binding the event handler.

### **3. What is the difference between synthetic events and native events in React?**
Synthetic Events are a cross-browser wrapper around native events, offering normalized functionality.

### **4. How do you handle form input events in React?**
Form input events like `onChange` are used with controlled components, where state is updated on user input.

### **5. What is the `onSubmit` event handler in React?**
`onSubmit` handles form submissions, and `event.preventDefault()` is often used to prevent the default form submission behavior.

### **6. What is event delegation in React?**
Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events for child elements, improving performance.

### **7. How do you stop an event's default behavior in React?**
Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop the default behavior, such as stopping a form from submitting.

### **8. How do you stop the propagation of an event in React?**
Use `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the event from bubbling up to parent elements.

### **9. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React with respect to events?**
Controlled components manage form data using React state, while uncontrolled components rely on the DOM itself using refs.

### **10. How do you bind `this` to event handlers in class components?**
In class components, you bind `this` to event handlers either in the constructor or by using arrow functions.
