Here is a list of commonly asked **Python interview questions and answers** to help you prepare for your interview:

### 1. **What is Python?**
   **Answer**: Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It is known for its readability and simplicity, which makes it popular for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

### 2. **What are the key features of Python?**
   **Answer**: Some key features of Python include:
   - Easy to read and write syntax
   - Dynamically typed
   - Object-oriented programming
   - Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional)
   - Extensive standard library
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Interactive shell

### 3. **What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?**
   **Answer**: 
   - **List**: A list is mutable (its elements can be changed), and is defined using square brackets `[]`.
   - **Tuple**: A tuple is immutable (its elements cannot be changed), and is defined using parentheses `()`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # mutable
     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  # immutable
     ```

### 4. **What are Pythonâ€™s built-in data types?**
   **Answer**: The built-in data types in Python include:
   - **Numeric types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`
   - **Sequence types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
   - **Text type**: `str`
   - **Set types**: `set`, `frozenset`
   - **Mapping type**: `dict`
   - **Boolean type**: `bool`
   - **Binary types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

### 5. **What is a function in Python?**
   **Answer**: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can accept arguments (inputs) and return values (outputs). Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword.
   ```python
   def my_function(a, b):
       return a + b
   result = my_function(5, 3)  # returns 8
   ```

### 6. **What is a lambda function?**
   **Answer**: A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but only has one expression.
   ```python
   add = lambda x, y: x + y
   result = add(5, 3)  # returns 8
   ```

### 7. **What is a Python dictionary?**
   **Answer**: A Python dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type.
   ```python
   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
   ```

### 8. **What are Python decorators?**
   **Answer**: Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are used to wrap another function, allowing you to add functionality to it.
   ```python
   def decorator_function(original_function):
       def wrapper_function():
           print("Before function call")
           original_function()
           print("After function call")
       return wrapper_function
   
   @decorator_function
   def say_hello():
       print("Hello!")
   
   say_hello()  # Outputs: Before function call, Hello!, After function call
   ```

### 9. **What is the difference between `deepcopy()` and `copy()` in Python?**
   **Answer**: 
   - **`copy()`**: Creates a shallow copy of an object, meaning it copies the references of the objects within the original object, not the objects themselves.
   - **`deepcopy()`**: Creates a deep copy of an object, meaning it copies the objects themselves and all objects referenced by them.
   ```python
   import copy
   my_list = [1, [2, 3]]
   shallow_copy = copy.copy(my_list)  # shallow copy
   deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(my_list)  # deep copy
   ```

### 10. **What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?**
   **Answer**:
   - **`==`**: Used to compare the values of two objects.
   - **`is`**: Used to compare the memory addresses (identity) of two objects.
   ```python
   a = [1, 2, 3]
   b = [1, 2, 3]
   print(a == b)  # True (values are equal)
   print(a is b)  # False (different memory locations)
   ```

### 11. **What is exception handling in Python?**
   **Answer**: Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program. In Python, exceptions are handled using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`.
   ```python
   try:
       x = 1 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError as e:
       print("Cannot divide by zero!")
   ```

### 12. **What is the `self` keyword in Python?**
   **Answer**: `self` is a reference to the instance of the class. It is used to access variables and methods associated with the current object.

### 13. **What is a Python module?**
   **Answer**: A module is a file that contains Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables, and can be imported into other Python programs to be reused.
   ```python
   import math
   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0
   ```

### 14. **What are Python's built-in functions?**
   **Answer**: Python includes many built-in functions like `print()`, `len()`, `sum()`, `type()`, `range()`, etc., which help perform common tasks.
   ```python
   print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Outputs: 3
   ```

### 15. **What is list comprehension in Python?**
   **Answer**: List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists. It consists of an expression followed by a `for` loop.
   ```python
   my_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
   ```

### 16. **Explain the `with` statement in Python.**
   **Answer**: The `with` statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code, ensuring that certain tasks are performed automatically, such as closing files after use.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
       content = file.read()
   ```

### 17. **What is a generator in Python?**
   **Answer**: A generator is a function that returns an iterator, one value at a time. Generators are written using `yield` instead of `return`.
   ```python
   def my_generator():
       for i in range(3):
           yield i

   gen = my_generator()
   for value in gen:
       print(value)  # Outputs: 0, 1, 2
   ```

### 18. **What is a Python iterator?**
   **Answer**: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It implements two methods:
   - `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object itself.
   - `__next__()`: Returns the next value in the sequence.

### 19. **What is the purpose of `global` keyword in Python?**
   **Answer**: The `global` keyword allows you to modify the value of a variable defined outside the current function scope (in the global scope).
   ```python
   x = 10
   def change_global():
       global x
       x = 20

   change_global()
   print(x)  # Outputs: 20
   ```

### 20. **What is Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?**
   **Answer**: The GIL is a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound tasks but doesn't significantly affect I/O-bound tasks.
